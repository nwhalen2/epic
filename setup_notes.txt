- run 'python3 get-pip.py' in this directory

- export the package in your .bashrc file

- source ~/.bashrc

- pip install virtualenv

- make sure you are in 'epic' top-level directory

- run 'make install'
(this installs all the required dependencies)

- run 'source ./Epic_Translation/epic_venv/bin/activate' to activate virtual environment

- run 'make run' to execute translate.py

- run 'make test' to execute unit tests

- run 'make deactivate'
(this removes the virtual environment - do this before making commits so
that there aren't a bunch of random files in GitHub!)

- add any external packages to 'requirements.txt'
